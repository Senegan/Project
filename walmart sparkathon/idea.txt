very bad customer service but compare to the overall customer the negative response percentage is less but it is vary low compare to other company


idea:
1. an ai to pitch the customer feedback and response immediately to make them satsfy
2. give reply of the problem resolved to respected customer
3. sometime customer get expired snacks
4. medical tablet they not provide real sometimes fake phills
5. poor ai chat and no explanation in email or msg
